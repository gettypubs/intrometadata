algorithm

A formula or procedure for solving a problem or carrying out a task. An algorithm is a set of steps in a very specific order, such as a mathematical formula or the instructions in a computer program. <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-LT-Cond-Ital">See also</span> <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">computer program</span>.

application

A software program designed to accomplish a task for an end user (e.g., word processing or project management), as distinguished from the operating system program that runs the computer itself.

application profile

A set of metadata elements, policies, and guidelines defined for a particular application or community. The elements may be from one or more element sets, thus allowing a given application to meet its functional requirements by using metadata from several element sets, including locally defined elements.

application programming interface (API)

A set of standardized requests defined by one computer program that allows another program to make requests and receive responses.

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

A seven-bit character code defining 128 characters used for information interchange, data processing, and communications systems.

authentication

A human or machine process that verifies that an individual, computer, or information object is who or what it purports to be.

authority file

A file, typically electronic, that serves as a source of standardized forms of names, terms, titles, etc. Authority files should include references or links from variant forms to preferred forms. For example, in the Library of Congress Name Authority File, “Schiavone, Andrea” is the preferred name form for a Dalmatian artist active in Italy during the sixteenth century, while “Medulic´, Andrija,” “Lo Schiavone,” and several other forms are listed as variant names. Authority files regulate usage but also provide additional access points, thus increasing both the precision and recall of many searches.

authority heading

A preferred, authorized heading used in a vocabulary, particularly in a bibliographic authority file that typically includes a string of names or terms, with additional information as necessary to allow disambiguation between identical headings (e.g., <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-LT-Cond-Ital">United States—History—Civil War, 1861–1865—Battlefields and United States—History—Civil War, 1861–1865—Campaigns</span>). The types of authority headings used by the Library of Congress are the following: subject, name, title, name/title, and keyword.

Logical operators used as modifiers to refine the relationship between terms in a search. The four most commonly used Boolean operators are AND, OR, NOT, and ADJ (adjacent). They may be used with parentheses and other punctuation to form logical groupings of criteria in queries—e.g., <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-LT-Cond-Ital">(Castillo OR Rancho) AND Diego</span>.

browsing

The process whereby a user of a system or web site visually scans and maneuvers through navigation lists, results lists, hierarchical displays, or other content in order to make a selection, as contrasted to the user entering a search term in a search box. <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-LT-Cond-Ital">See also</span> <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">searching</span>.

A specific set of instructions for ordered operations that result in the completion of a task by the computer; a computer program consists of <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">computer code</span>. While the program is technically a type of data, computer programs are generally considered as separate from the data to which they refer (e.g., data would be the terms, scope notes, etc., in a vocabulary record). An <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-LT-Cond-Ital">interactive</span> program acts when prompted by an action or information supplied by a user; a <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-LT-Cond-Ital">batch</span> program automatically runs at a certain time or under certain conditions and then stops after the task is completed.

digital asset management system

A type of system for organizing digital media assets, such as digital images or video clips, for storage and retrieval. Digital asset management systems sometimes incorporate a descriptive data cataloging component, but they tend to focus on managing workflow for creating digital assets and for managing asset rights, requests, and permissions.

digital signatures

A form of electronic <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">authentication</span> of a digital document. Digital signatures are created and verified using public key cryptography and serve to tie the document being signed to the signer.

digital surrogate

A digital “copy” of an original work or item (e.g., a JPEG or TIFF image of a painting or sculpture, or a PDF file of an article or book). In Open Archives Initiative nomenclature, digital surrogates are often referred to as “resources.”

document

In the context of search and retrieval, the combination of a defined, primarily self-contained, machine-readable text and the format in which it is expressed.

domain name

The address that identifies an Internet or other network site. On the Internet, domain names act as mnemonic aliases for IP addresses, a hierarchical numeric addressing system that enables Internet hosts to be uniquely identified. The hierarchical nature of the Domain Name System means that the authority for issuing subdomain names is delegated down the hierarchy; for example, once the Getty Trust has registered the domain name “[getty.edu](),” it is responsible for any subdomain names such as “[www.getty.edu,]()” “[shiva.getty.edu](),” etc.

Dublin Core Metadata Element Set

[http://www.loc.gov/ead]()/

encryption

An encoding mechanism used to prevent unauthorized users from reading digital information and also for user and document authentication. Only designated users or recipients have the capability to decode encrypted materials.

end user

In the context of systems design, the term refers to any client for whom a database system is designed and operated; from that perspective, it could include the editors or catalogers for whom an editorial or cataloging system has been designed.

entity relationship model

A type of <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">conceptual data model</span> that represents structured data in terms of entities and relationships. An entity relationship diagram can be used to visually represent information objects and their relationships. Because the constructs used in the entity relationship model can easily be transformed into relational tables, this type of model is often used in database design.

Exif (Exchangeable Image File Format)

A specification for an image file format for digital cameras that provides the ability to attach image metadata to JPEG, TIFF, and RIFF images.

false hit

In search and retrieval, an entry in a list of results that does not comply with the user’s intended results. <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-LT-Cond-Ital">Also</span> called a <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">false drop</span>.

federated searching

<span class="Helv-Lt-Std-LT-Cond-Ital">Also</span> called<span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">,</span><span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond"> cross-database searching</span><span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">,</span><span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond"> metasearching</span><span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">,</span><span class="Strong"> </span>and <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">parallel searching.</span> Performing queries simultaneously across resources residing in different domains and created by different communities. Federated searching may involve searching across multiple databases, different platforms, and varying protocols, thus requiring the application of <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">interoperability</span> between resources and vocabularies.

field mapping <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-LT-Cond-Ital">See</span> <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">crosswalk</span>.

finding aid

A measure of a search system’s effectiveness in terms of retrieving all results that are possibly relevant, expressed as the ratio of the number of relevant records or documents retrieved over all the relevant records or documents. A high recall search retrieves a comprehensive set of relevant results; however, it also increases the likelihood that marginally relevant <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">content objects</span> will also be retrieved. Recall and <span class="Helv-Lt-Std-Bold-Cond">precision</span> are inversely related (when one goes up, the other goes down).
