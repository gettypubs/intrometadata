      <td>Harvesting</td>
      <td>Records expressed in a standard metadata schema (e.g., Dublin Core) are made available by data providers on specially configured servers. The records are harvested, batch processed, and made available by service providers from a single database or index. The service provider preprocesses the contributed data and stores it locally before it is made available for searching by users. In order for records to be added or updated, data providers must post fresh metadata records, and service providers must reharvest, batch process, and integrate the new and updated records into the union catalog.</td>

      <td>Metasearch of distributed metadata records</td>
      <td>Diverse databases on different platforms and often with different metadata schemas are searched in real time via one or more protocols (e.g. Z39.50, screen scraping, APIs). The service provider does not preprocess or store data but rather processes data only when a user launches a search. Search results are usually displayed target-by-target, as integrating retrieved records from each different database into a single ranked result set is difficult and time consuming.</td>
